# Special discount countdown page âŒ›

In this practice project, I successfully created a mobile discount page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page features a range of enticing discount offers for products or services. I focused on using an appealing color scheme throughout the design to capture users' attention.
To make the page interactive, I incorporated JavaScript to add functionality. I implemented a countdown timer for limited-time offers to create a sense of urgency. Overall, this practice project allowed me to explore the possibilities of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating a captivating mobile discount page. I enjoyed the process of designing and developing the page, leveraging attractive colors to grab users' attention and deliver an engaging experience.
